This calm and majestic composition is built around the formal antagonism between the hard and the soft, between the living and the geometric, revealing a newfound taste for the motif of the curve.
In his text Toile Vide, etc. (Canvas, Space, etc.), Kandinsky writes: "I look through my window. Several cold factory chimneys stand in silence. They're inflexible. All of a sudden, smoke rises from a single chimney. The wind curves it and it instantly changes color. The whole world has changed." The forms, resembling transfer images floating to the surface, contrast with the assertion of the large, colored diagonal lines, which are exceptional in Kandinsky's work.
