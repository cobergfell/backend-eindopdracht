Kandinsky’s comments:

Additional definition

1. Mass (Weights)
Colors
in the middle at the bottom – blue (providing cold tone to the whole)
on the right at the top – separated blue, red and yellow
on the left at the top – black interlacing lines of horses
on the right at the bottom – extended lines of lying figures

2. Contrasts
between mass and line
between precision and blur
between line interlacing and color interlacing, and
the main contrast between sharp abrupt movement (battle) and light cold delicate colors

3. Overlapping
of contours by colors.
Only all outlines of the castle are weakened by the sky flowing through its contour.


4. Two centers:
1. Line interlacing
2. A sharp shape modeled by blue
separated from each other by two vertical black lines (lances)


The whole composition is conceived as a very light one, with a great number of delicate tones which often flow into each other (resolution), yellow is also cold. The relation of the light, delicate and cold to the sharp movement (war) makes the main contrast in the picture. Here, in my opinion, this contrast is even stronger as compared to “Composition II” but it is also firmer (internally), more explicit; its advantage is a more accurate impression; the disadvantage is excessive obviousness of this accuracy.

The following elements form the basis:
1. The harmony of calm masses
2. Calm movement of certain parts, mainly to the right and upwards
3. Predominant sharp movement to the left and downwards
4. Contradiction inside both directions (small shapes move to the left inside the rightward movement, etc.)
5. Harmony of masses and simple lying lines
6. Contrast of blurred and contoured forms (i.e. line as just a line and as a contour which sounds like a line itself)
7. Overlapping of shape boundaries by colors
8. Predominance of the sound of colors over the sound of shapes
9. Resolutions
